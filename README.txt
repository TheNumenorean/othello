Francesco designed and built the structure of the AI and all the helper classes, and coded the OthelloAI classes.

Dillon programmed the implementation of the AIThread run() method, as well as made modifications to other classes including the board class.


To make the Ai tournament worthy, we fixed a multitude of errors that were still occuring, and fixed the minimax algorithm to calculate the proper values. Overall we made it more stable, and the algorithm should be good enough to beat most other AIs, given that it takes heavy advantage of multithreading.
